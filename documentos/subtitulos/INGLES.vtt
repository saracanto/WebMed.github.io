Hello, in this video we are going to do a search&nbsp;
of an article through the WebMed page,

00:00:06.867 --> 00:00:11.984
which is a medical encyclopedia for students&nbsp;
of health engineering and medicine.

00:00:11.984 --> 00:00:14.920
On the left side of the screen&nbsp;
we see a navigation bar with

00:00:15.017 --> 00:00:19.350
the different sections presented by the&nbsp;
home page, such as website map,

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.350
medical items finder, form&nbsp;
registry, alphabetical index and featured topics.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.017
To search for the item we want, we go to&nbsp; the alphabetical index and look for an article that

00:00:31.017 --> 00:00:36.834
For example, start with the letter A,we stand&nbsp;about the letter for which we want to search

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:44.000
the article in this case the letter A and we click.
We are shown a new screen with a list

00:00:44.017 --> 00:00:50.550
of diseases and articles where we can&nbsp;
choose the one we want, for example Alzheimer's.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.760
It redirects us to a page where we are&nbsp;
shows the chosen article, Alzheimer's,

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.440
with different aspects about this disease.&nbsp;
On the left side of the screen we return

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.200
find a navigation bar with the&nbsp;
different characteristics of the disease such as

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:12.080
description, causes, symptoms, tests and examinations,&nbsp;
treatments, expectations and parts of the brain,

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.080
This organization will be maintained by the majority of&nbsp;
the items depending on the importance

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.360
that they have in certain parts of the body.
Using the keyboard tab we can

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.880
access to jump to the main content, which&nbsp;
position at the beginning of the article starting with

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:36.284
description. Furthermore, by selecting the section
that we want to investigate, for example, causes,

00:01:36.284 --> 00:01:43.000
we are redirected to that part of the web page&nbsp;
where this characteristic is described to us.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
After finishing reading the article we can access&nbsp;again to the index of the letter A or to the main

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.017
page to be able to do a search for another&nbsp;article that begins with a different letter

00:01:55.017 --> 00:02:03.634
for example the L we select an article and as&nbsp;
we have said before we can see that they have a

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.840
similar content. This would be the process for&nbsp;
search for an article on our website,

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.160
